Find already simulated data:

Already simulated data for first age distribution is found in relative path "../../ageDist1",
 for the second age distribution in "../../ageDist2". 

Evaluate data in various ways: 

	evalMeanVsT: plot mean of specified obervable vs time steps
	evalObsVsPar: plot specified observable (one per parameter) vs a range of the parameter
	evalHeatMap: same as ObsVsPar, but with both parameters (vaccination (idx=3) and sDistFakt (idx = 7) -> heat map 
	evalR0: calculate R0 from steps of numbers of infected, plot VS time steps
